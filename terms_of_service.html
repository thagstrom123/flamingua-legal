    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully before using the Flamingua mobile application (the
        “Service”) operated by the Flamingua Team (Tobias Hagstrom) (“we”, “us”, or “our”).</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you
        may not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>The Service is intended for users aged 13 and older. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you
        meet this age requirement.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscriptions”). Subscriptions are billed in
        advance on a recurring basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are typically monthly unless otherwise stated at
        the time of purchase.</p>

    <h3>Auto-Renewal</h3>
    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless
        you cancel it or the Subscription is terminated by us.</p>

    <h3>Cancellation</h3>
    <p>You may manage or cancel your Subscription at any time through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store
        subscription settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.</p>

    <h2>Payments and Refunds</h2>
    <p>All payments, billing, and refunds are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store in accordance with
        their respective terms and policies. We do not process payments directly and cannot issue refunds outside of the
        app store mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>Flamingua Pro</h2>
    <p>A Flamingua Pro subscription provides access to premium content and features, including advanced learning units
        and enhanced voice-based functionality. The specific content and features included in Flamingua Pro may change
        over time.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to misuse
        the Service, attempt to interfere with its operation, or use it in a way that could harm the Service or other
        users.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express
        or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or fully accurate at all
        times.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
        special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use of the Service, even if we
        have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>Canton of Zug,
            Switzerland</strong>, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at our sole discretion. If a change is material, we will
        make reasonable efforts to provide notice before the updated Terms take effect. Continued use of the Service
        after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
