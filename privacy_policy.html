    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your
        information when You use the Flamingua mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <p><em>This policy describes only the data your use of this app causes to be collected, used, or stored by Flamingua
            or its service providers. It does not cover data that is not collected or retained.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Application</strong> means the software program provided by the Company downloaded by You on any
        electronic device, named Flamingua.</p>
    <p><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to
        the <strong>Flamingua Team (Tobias Hagstrom)</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

    <h4>Usage Data</h4>
    <p>
        Usage Data may be collected automatically when you use the Service. This can include information such as your
        device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address (as seen by our servers when you connect), device identifiers, app
        version, and diagnostic information needed to operate and secure the Service.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Purpose of Collection:</strong> We use Usage Data to operate the Service, troubleshoot issues, prevent
        abuse, and improve reliability.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Analytics:</strong> We do not use third-party analytics SDKs for behavioral tracking at this time. If we
        add analytics in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h4>Text and Learning Content (AI Features)</h4>
    <p>
        When you use AI-powered features (such as chat, writing feedback, or lesson assistance), the Application may
        process text that you enter, as well as limited learning context (for example: the current unit/lesson and
        recent dialogue turns) in order to generate feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose of Collection:</strong> This data is used solely to provide learning functionality and feedback.
        It is not used for advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Retention:</strong> Text and context are processed transiently for the purpose of responding to your
        request. We do not intentionally build a personal profile about you. Chat history and progress are stored
        primarily on-device in local storage.
    </p>

    <h4>Voice and Audio Data</h4>
    <p>
        The Application may collect and process voice and audio input when You actively choose to use speaking or
        pronunciation features within the Service. Audio recording occurs only after explicit user interaction
        (e.g. pressing a microphone or record button) and is not performed in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose of Collection:</strong> Audio data is used solely to enable speech-based learning features,
        such as pronunciation practice and language feedback. Audio data is processed transiently and discarded after
        evaluation. It is not used for advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <h4>In-App Purchases & Third-Party Services</h4>
    <p>We use third-party services to facilitate portions of our Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. We may share anonymous User IDs with
            RevenueCat to validate subscription status and entitlements. We do not receive or store your payment card
            details.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store & Google Play Store:</strong> These stores process all payments. Their use of your
            personal information (including financial data) is governed by their respective Privacy Policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Delete Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        Flamingua does not require an account. Most learning progress and preferences are stored locally on your device.
        Because Flamingua does not maintain personal user accounts or persistent user profiles on our servers, there is
        no server-side user data that can be retrieved or deleted beyond transient processing.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Delete on-device data:</strong> Open the app and go to <strong>Settings → Delete Data</strong>.
        This clears local app data (such as learning progress, preferences, and app state) from your device and resets
        the app.</p>
    <p><strong>What is deleted:</strong> Local learning progress, preferences, and other app state stored on the device.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What may be retained:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscription records:</strong> If you have an active subscription, purchase and receipt information
            is processed by the Apple App Store / Google Play Store and our subscription provider (RevenueCat). These
            records may be retained as required for billing, accounting, fraud prevention, or legal compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Server logs:</strong> Our servers may retain limited technical logs (such as IP address and request
            metadata) for security and reliability for a short, limited period, after which they are automatically
            deleted or anonymized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You have the right to request access to or deletion of personal data we may hold about you. Since Flamingua does
        not use personal accounts, most data can be deleted directly in the app via <strong>Settings → Delete
            Data</strong>. If you need assistance, contact us at <a
            href="mailto:flamingua.app@gmail.com">flamingua.app@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>As the Application is account-free, local data is retained on your device until the Application is uninstalled or
        manually reset via the Settings menu.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Flamingua is intended for teens and adults (13+). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
        from children under 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with
        Personal Data, please contact Us.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
