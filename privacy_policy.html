    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your
        information when You use the Flamingua mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Account</strong> means a unique account created for You to access our Service or parts of our Service.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> means the software program provided by the Company downloaded by You on any
        electronic device, named Flamingua.</p>
    <p><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to
        the <strong>Flamingua Team (Tobias Hagstrom)</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

    <h4>Usage Data</h4>
    <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. This may include your device's Internet Protocol
        address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that You visit, the time and
        date of Your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose of Collection:</strong> Usage Data is used to operate and improve the Service, monitor usage
        patterns, and diagnose technical issues. We may share aggregated, non-identifiable usage data with analytics and
        infrastructure providers to improve app performance.</p>

    <h4>Voice and Audio Data</h4>
    <p>
        The Application may collect and process voice and audio input when You actively choose to use speaking or
        pronunciation features within the Service. Audio recording occurs only after explicit user interaction
        (e.g. pressing a microphone or record button) and is not performed in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose of Collection:</strong> Audio data is used solely to enable speech-based learning features,
        such as pronunciation practice, speaking exercises, and language feedback. Audio recordings may be processed
        temporarily on-device or transmitted securely to third-party speech processing or evaluation services in
        order to provide feedback. Audio data is not used for advertising purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Retention:</strong> Audio recordings are not stored permanently unless explicitly stated within the
        feature. In most cases, audio data is processed transiently and discarded after evaluation.
    </p>

    <h4>In-App Purchases & Third-Party Services</h4>
    <p>We use third-party services to facilitate portions of our Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. We may share anonymous User IDs with
            RevenueCat to validate subscription status and entitlements. We do not receive or store your payment card
            details.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store & Google Play Store:</strong> These stores process all payments. Their use of your
            personal information (including financial data) is governed by their respective Privacy Policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless
        a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter
        period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of Our Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child
        has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
